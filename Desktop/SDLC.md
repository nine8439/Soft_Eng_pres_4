#V-Model (See Image in repo, credit: http://softobiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/v-model.png)

##Intro
    + Response to perceived weakness found in the waterfall model
    + Similar to waterfall model
    + Problems with the Waterfall model
        1. Errors and Bugs in the software in the development process, which is very late in the life cycle
        2. Fixing errors and bugs becomes costly and challenging because it is in a later stage in the life cycle
    + "V Model" was introduced to fix this problem
    + The development process does not emphasize any phase specifically. 
    + The process relies on verification from the previous steps before it moves forward.
    + Each cycle has multiple phases, and each one of these phases should yield a predefined product. 
    + When one phase completes, it then forms the foundation for the next phase.
    + Similar to waterfall, you only move on to the next step when the previous step has been completed. 
    + The product is verified at each stage, and cannot move forward until it has been completely verified at a stage

##Requirement Analysis

    + The requirement analysis is the first stage in the V Model
    + The function is decided. Requirements are collected and the needs of the user are analyzed.
    + Determine what the "Ideal System" has to perfrom
    + Users are interviewed and requirements document is generated
    

##System Design
    
    + Engineers analyze and understand the business of the proposed system by studying the user requirements document.
    + The Engineers devise the possibilites by which the user requirements can be implemented
    + User is informed in this state if any of the requirements are infeasible. The user document is then edited accordingly
    + After this, the software specification document for the development phase is generated. 
    + The software specification document contains how the general system is organized, menu structures, data structures, etc.
